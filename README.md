_A fun applicaiton which combines math and ping-pong, {01/20/2017}_

By _**Grinil Khanna**_

## Description

_All you have to do is input a number. Divisibles by 3, 5, and 15, will return ping, pong, and ping-pong relatively._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Load the page_
* _Read the instructions_
* _Input a number_
* _And get your results!_

## Logic for Construction
1. A number can be inputted and return the boolean "true" in the result div.
2. If a number is divisible by 3, "true" is shown.
3. If a number is divisible by 5, "true" is shown.
4. If a number is divisible by 15, "true" is shown.
5. If none of the above are true, the inputted value itself is returend.
6. An array is created from the inputted number to the number "1".
7.The functions of divisibles, and number array, are combined to demonstrate the divisibles from the inputted number to "1". 

## Known Bugs

_It will not function. The backend organization has errors and still needs work to yield full functionality._
